In project we learn about the preprocessor.
Preprocesing is a stage where our source file is passed through a preprocessor to do the following:
- Define macros.
- include header files.
- Remove comments.

## Learning Objective.
- What are macros and how to use them.
- What are the most common predefined macros.
- How to include guard your header files.
