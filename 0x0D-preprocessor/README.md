# 0x0D-preprocessor

In project we learn about the preprocessor.
Preprocesing is a stage where our source file is passed through a preprocessor to do the following:
- Define macros.
- include header files.
- Remove comments.

## Learning Objective.
- What are macros and how to use them.
- What are the most common predefined macros.
- How to include guard your header files.

## Tasks

| File | Description | Lesson |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 0-object_like_macro.h | Create a header file that defines a macro named <code>SIZE<code>| Defining macros and Using guards to evade double inclusion |
| 1-pi.h | Create a header file that defines a macro named PI | Representation PI using macros |
| 2-main.c | Write a program that prints the name of the file | Using predefined macros |
| 3-function_like_macro.h | Write a function-like macro ABS(x) that computes the absolute value of a number | Making numbers absolute and Using macroargumaents like funtions |
| 4-sum.h | Write a function-like macro SUM(x, y) that computes the sum of the numbers  | Using macro arguments as functions. |
